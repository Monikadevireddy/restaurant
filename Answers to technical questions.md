Q1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
A. It took me around 1hr 30mins for developing the code. I would like to add a filter(by click) to auto sort the restaurants with their user rating and add a column to display the distance from search location(real time)

Q2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
A. New feature recently I have learned and worked on is about Routing in MVC as a course at my college in Canada. Sorry I don't have snippet of code. 
Also I have got a chance to learn and explore a new tool called "Tableau". Below snippet is one of my practice result.
 

Q3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
A. The organisation I worked before was using Dynatrace to monitor the application dynamics but I never got a chance to troubleshoot/work on performance related issues. 

Q4. How would you improve the API that you just used?
A. I found few issues like: 400 Bad request error which may be occured due to some invalid syntax also 401 Unauthorized error means I'm not authorized to access.
